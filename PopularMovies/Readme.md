The Movie Database TMDb
------------------------
This project depends on The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
"This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb."
The developer's key for TMDb has been removed from the sources posted to github.
You may obtain your own TMDb developer's key by signing up for an account at https://www.themoviedb.org,
then select the API and request a key.
Once you have a key, use it to initialize MovieDBAPIKey in the java code of this project.
